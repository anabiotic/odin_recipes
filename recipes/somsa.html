    <h3>What is beef plov?</h3>
    <p>
      Beef plov is a one-pot Uzbek dish made with rice, beef, carrots, onions,
      garlic, and spices. While it’s a traditional Uzbek dish, it’s also popular
      among Russian and Ukrainian families. It’s a total comfort food designed
      to feed a lot of people, making it the perfect family-friendly recipe!

    <h3>Beef rice pilaf ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Beef</strong> – Beef chuck, sirloin, or short ribs, or lamb
        works the best. The meat is cut into 1 inch pieces and seared before
        it’s cooked with the veggies and rice in a dutch oven. Each piece
        becomes so tender and juicy in the end.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Rice</strong> – A medium grain rice is best for this pilaf
        recipe. I like to use Calrose rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vegetables</strong> – Carrots and onions are sauteed along with
        the meat while a full head of garlic is tucked into and cooked with the
        rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Spices</strong> – All you need is cumin, turmeric, and salt.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to make Uzbek beef plov</h3>
    <p>
      This one-pot recipe makes plenty for everyone! Once the beef is tender and
      the rice is cooked, you can dig into the easy Uzbek plov:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Rinse the rice.</strong> Add the rice to a fine-mesh strainer
        and rinse under cold water until the water is coming out clear. Once
        that’s done, place the rice in a bowl with water.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sear the beef.</strong> Heat the oil in a dutch oven or
        heavy-bottomed pot over high heat and add the seasoned beef. Sear until
        all sides are brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Saute the vegetables and spices.</strong> Turn down the heat,
        then add the onions and cook until they’re soft. Stir in the carrots and
        spices. Pour the water into the pot and add salt. Add a lid on top of
        the pot and simmer.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the rice.</strong> Pour the rice into the pot and tuck the
        garlic head in the center. Cover the pot with the lid and cook. Don’t
        stir or fluff the rice until you think it’s ready to eat.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve and enjoy!</strong>
        Once it’s ready, take the head of garlic out of the pilaf and fluff the
        rice with a fork. Stir everything together, then serve!
      </li>
    </ol>
